The DeepEnv project aims to tackle some of the environmental problems using Deep Learning.

We'll be focusing on areas mentioned by the National Geographic's AI for Earth Innovation project.

Climate Change: Countries and communities around the world are engaged in climate resilience, adaptation, and mitigation efforts. AI can help in areas such as these:

- Understanding and quantifying carbon sequestration 
- Monitoring and understanding afforestation/reforestation efforts
- Identifying fire risks and ways to mitigate damage
- Extreme weather and climate modeling
- Sustainable land-use change
- Resilience to impacts caused by extreme events (e.g., droughts, floods, other natural disasters)
